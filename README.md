# Remote Sensing Analysis of Vegetation Burning and Regrowth - Eagle Creek Fire

This remote sensing project utilizes supervised classification models and remote sensing techniques (band composites, NDVI change detection) to analyze satellite imagery, assessing vegetation damage and recovery in the context of the Eagle Creek forest fire. Python Scikit-Learn, ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, and Google Earth are used to process and visualize changes over time, delivering ecological insights about the regionâ€™s regrowth.
